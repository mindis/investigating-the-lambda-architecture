/*
Q2. Get all precipitation observed once in an hour.
Although similar to Q1, this query is much more complex, because it requires re- turning all types of precipitation.
Since the triple patterns for different kinds of precipitations maybe different, OPTIONAL patterns are needed to
capture the possible differences. Additionally, this query requires reasoning over all instances of the class
PrecipitationObservation and its subclasses.
