Q6. Get the stations that have observed extremely low visibility in the last hour.
Next to direct measurements of low visibility (<10 centimetres), heavy snowfall and rainfall (> 30 centimetres) also
cause low visibility. This is a more complex example of detecting extreme weather conditions, which requires not only
gaining knowledge explicitly contained in the data, but also deriving implicit knowledge from data sources.
